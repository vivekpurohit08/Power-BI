# Power-BI
The project involved developing a Power BI dashboard for an eCommerce store with the aim of generating insights into the performance of the store. The dashboard included various charts and slicers that showcased detailed information about the store's sales, customer behavior, and product trends.

The dashboard utilized data from multiple sources, including the store's transactional data and web analytics data, and was designed to provide a comprehensive view of the store's performance. The project also involved data cleaning and preparation to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data used.

The various charts and slicers on the dashboard enabled users to drill down into the data and analyze it from various angles, including by time period, customer segment, and product category. The dashboard provided real-time data updates and was highly interactive, allowing users to filter and sort data to get the exact insights they needed.

Overall, the Power BI dashboard created for this project was highly effective in providing actionable insights into the eCommerce store's performance, and helped the store make data-driven decisions to optimize its sales and marketing strategies.
